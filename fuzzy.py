    Given a set of data, a list of initial centroids, the fuzzification parameter,
    the number of clusters and conditions for the loopÂ´s body, returns the fuzzy partition matrix.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : list of points.
    initial_centroids : list of initial centroids (needed because if any centroid is the same as one of the data points,
                                                   the algorithm will fail).
    m : fuzzification parameter (usually set to 2).
    c : number of clusters.
    eps : minimum difference between new and old centroids for finishing the loop.
    max_iter : maximum number of iterations.
    dist : distance to use.

    Returns
    -------
    fuzzy partition matrix.

    Complexity
    -------
    O(N*(C^2)*I) where N: number of points.
                   C: number of clusters.
                   I: maximum number of iterations.
